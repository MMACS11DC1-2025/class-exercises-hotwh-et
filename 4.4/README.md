# Recursive Fractal Generator
When you first run the program, it will be a blank canvas. Nothing will happen until you spawn something with an input.

## Inputs
### Spawning a fractal ball
Spawn a fractal ball by simply putting a number in the input. This number will be the length of the first branch.\
```
Input: 50
```

### Configuring settings
All of the following settings are available to be changed:
- Max FPS
- Speed
- Width
- Branch angle range
- Branches
- Min branch length
- Decline rate

__Max FPS__\
This is simply a cap on FPS, and does not actually change the performance. This is meant to prevent fluctuations in FPS when changing settings

__Speed__\
This a multiplier to the vector, and does not impact the performance

__Width__\
This defines the width of the stroke, and makes no impact to the radius of the balls
